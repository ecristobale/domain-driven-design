## DESCRIPTION
The **goal** of this project is to create a dummy **DDD** app using **Spring Boot 3** and **Java 21** . 
Based on initial requirements, we create entities, we define 3 domains: flights, hotels and tour. 
We implement domain model service for tour with simulated http client calls to the two other domains and with execution of bussiness logic actions. Ubiquitous language is present in code methods.
